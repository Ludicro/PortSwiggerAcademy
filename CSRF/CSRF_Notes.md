# CSRF Notes
## When Attempting to Exploit CSRF Identify the Following:
    - Vulnerable Parameter
        - e.g. Email
    - Goal
        - Exploit the CSRF vulnerability to change the email address
    - Known credentials


## Defending Against CSRF:
- CSRF Tokens
    - A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client. When attempting to perform a sensitive action, such as submitting a form, the client must include the correct CSRF token in request.
    - Can be sent in the post request that gets or in HTTP request header.
- SameSite Cookies
    - SameSite is a browser security mechanism that determines when a website's cookies are included in requests originating from other websites. 
    - As requests to perform sensitive actions typically require an authenticated session cookie, the appropriate SameSite restrictions may prevent an attacker from triggering these actions cross-site.
- Referrer-based Validation
    - Some applications make use of the HTTP header to attempt to defend against CSRF attacks, normally by verifying that the request originated from the application's own domain. 
    - This is generally less effective than CSRF token validation.
