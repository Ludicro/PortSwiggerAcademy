# PortSwigger Academy Notes and Walkthroughs

This is my collection of PortSwigger Academy notes and walkthroughs that I have completed during the course of my solving of the labs.

While this PDF is primarily for the purpose of my independent study at UofL which only requires the Server-side vulnerabilities, I have included all of the notes and walkthroughs for the other labs as well.
