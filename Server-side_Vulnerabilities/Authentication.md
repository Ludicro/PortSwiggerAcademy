# Authentication
> Authentication is the process of checking that a user really is who they claim to be. For example, a login form where you enter your username and password is one form of authentication mechanism. Flawed authentication mechanisms may allow an attacker to guess valid sets of credentials by automating thousands of login attempts using specialist tools like Burp Intruder.
